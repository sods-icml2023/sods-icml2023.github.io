We welcome submissions regarding sampling and optimization in discrete space, including but not limited to:
- Syncing up on the latest research progress in discrete sampling and optimization.
- Discussing limitations of the current methods and brainstorm the new algorithm paradigms.
- Connecting to applications in domains such as language/protein modeling, physics simulation, and bio/chemical engineering, where improved sampling/optimization in discrete space would help, and explore the current gap between the application requirements and the capability of existing methods.



We welcome both short research papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials), and full-length research papers of up to 9 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials).
