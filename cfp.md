**Submission deadline:** ~~Thursday, Sept 15, 2022 (16:59 PDT)~~ Thursday, Sept 22, 2022 (16:59 PDT)<br>

**Submission site (OpenReview): [NeurIPS 2022 GLFrontiers Workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/GLFrontiers)** <br>

**Author notification:** Friday, Oct 21, 2022

**Camera ready deadline:** Friday, Nov 4, 2022 (16:59 PDT)

**Workshop (in person):** Friday, Dec 2, 2022<br>

**Updates:** 
- Please use the following **[NeurIPS GLFrontiers style file](https://github.com/glfrontiers/glfrontiers.github.io/blob/master/files/neurips_glfrontiers_2022.sty)** for **the camera ready submission**, which has the correct notice at the first page of your paper. Please use the option `\usepackage[final]{neurips_glfrontiers_2022}` in your main text file. Please **upload your camera ready version via making a revision at OpenReview**.


The workshop will be held fully in person at the New Orleans Convention Center, as part of the [NeurIPS 2022 conference](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022).
We also plan to offer livestream for the event, and more details will come soon. 

We welcome submissions regarding the new frontiers of graph learning, including but not limited to:
- *Graphs in the wild:* Graph learning for datasets and applications without explicit relational structure (e.g., images, text, audios, code). Novel ways of modeling structured/unstructured data as graphs are highly welcomed.

- *Graphs in ML:* Graph representations in general machine learning problems (e.g., neural architectures as graphs, relations among input data and learning tasks, graphs in large language models, etc.)

- *New oasis:* Graph learning methods that are significantly different from the current paradigms (e.g., large-scale pre-trained models, multi-task models, super scalable algorithms, etc.)

- *New capabilities:* Graph representation for knowledge discovery, optimization, causal inference, explainable ML, ML fairness, etc.

- *Novel applications:* Novel applications of graph learning in real-world industry and scientific domains. (e.g., graph learning for missing data imputation, program synthesis, etc.) 




We welcome both short research papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials), and full-length research papers of up to ~~8~~ 9 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials). 
All accepted papers will be presented as posters. 
**We will select 6 papers for short spotlight presentations and 2 papers for the outstanding paper awards with cash incentives.**
**Speakers and DEI applicants with accepted papers are welcomed to apply for a limited amount of travel support** by [contact the workshop committee](mailto:glfrontiers@googlegroups.com).
We sincerely appreciate the sponsorship from Google on our workshop.


All submissions must use the [NeurIPS template](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). We do not require the authors to include the checklist in the template. Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable.

Should you have any questions, please reach out to us via email:<br>
