The workshop will be held fully in person at the Hawaii Convention Center, as a part of the [ICML 2023 conference](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023).
We also plan to offer a livestream for the event, and more details will come soon. 

We welcome submissions regarding sampling and optimization in discrete space, including but not limited to:
- Syncing up on the latest research progress in discrete sampling and optimization.
- Discussing limitations of the current methods and brainstorm the new algorithm paradigms.
- Connecting to applications in domains such as language/protein modeling, physics simulation, and bio/chemical engineering, where improved sampling/optimization in discrete space would help, and explore the current gap between the application requirements and the capability of existing methods.



We welcome both short research papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials), and full-length research papers of up to 9 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials). 
<!-- ~~8~~ 9 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials).  -->
All accepted papers will be presented as posters.
