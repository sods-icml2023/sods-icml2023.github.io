The workshop will be held fully in person at the New Orleans Convention Center, as part of the [ICML 2023 conference](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023).
We also plan to offer livestream for the event, and more details will come soon. 

We welcome submissions regarding sampling and optimization in discrete space, including but not limited to:
- Sync up on the latest research progress in discrete sampling and optimization.
- Discuss the limitation of the current methods and brainstorm the new paradigms of algorithms.
- Connect to the applications in domains like language/protein modeling, physics simulation, and bio/chemical engineering, where the improved sampling/optimization in discrete space would help, and learn the current gap between the application needs and the capability of existing methods.




We welcome both short research papers of up to 4 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials), and full-length research papers of up to ~~8~~ 9 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials). 
All accepted papers will be presented as posters. 
**We will select 6 papers for short spotlight presentations and 2 papers for the outstanding paper awards with cash incentives.**
**Speakers and DEI applicants with accepted papers are welcomed to apply for a limited amount of travel support** by [contact the workshop committee](mailto:sods@googlegroups.com).

Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable. -->
